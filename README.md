## User Guide

Go to http://localhost:5173/. Users will first be met with a login page to log into Google OAuth.

When pressing the login button to sign in, the user will be prompted to confirm the login.

The user will be redirected to http://localhost:5173/dashboard, where the user can see existing posts. If the user attempts to reach this page without signing in, the user will not be able to view anything. The text in the dashboard screenshot below is the same if the user has no posts in the database.

When users sign in and put in some entries, this is what the dashboard looks like.
